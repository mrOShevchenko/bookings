# bookings
A web application for booking hotel rooms. Customers can check the availability of rooms for their selected dates in two ways:

Through the main menu, which will display a list of all available rooms.
By visiting the individual page for each room, which will show the availability for that specific room.
The application uses a Postgresql database to store room information and reservation data.
